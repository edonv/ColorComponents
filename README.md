# ColorComponents

`ColorComponents` is a lightweight library for convenient accessing of just that: a color's components. It allows for easy cross-compatability with Swift's different color types: `CGColor`, `UIColor`, `NSColor`, and SwiftUI's `Color`. Additionally, it provides a number of initializers and computed properties for convient compatability with hex color integers and strings (with and without alpha at the end), plus different permutations of hue/saturation/lightness. It also conforms to `Codable`, `RawRepresentable`, `Equatable`, and `Hashable` (it uses a hexadecimal integer under the hood for all of them).
